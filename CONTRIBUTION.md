# Contributing to T-Board
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track **public** issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Clone the repository on your local machine 
   1. You can use the command 'git clone https://github.com/ECE444-2023Fall/project-1-web-application-design-group4-3d3g.git' 
2. Create your branch from `master`.
   1. Use the command 'git checkout -b <feauture name>'
3. Develop your code, commit/push when you are done
   1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
   2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue a pull request! Our team will review your changes. 

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track **public** bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here are two example of what our team considers good bug reports:

- [Example 1](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626)
- [Example 2](http://www.openradar.me/11905408)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Our team is following [Google's Code Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/). Please make sure that any code changes you propose follows these guidelines.
